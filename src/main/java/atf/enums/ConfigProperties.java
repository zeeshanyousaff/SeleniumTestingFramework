//Define all you property file keys in enums and implement accordingly.The purpose of defining enums is to control how the values can be accessed in only a certain way.
/*An enum is a special "class" that represents a group of constants (unchangeable variables, like final variables).
To create an enum, use the enum keyword (instead of class or interface), and separate the constants with a comma.
Note that they should be in uppercase letters:
enum Level {
  LOW,
  MEDIUM,
  HIGH
}   */
